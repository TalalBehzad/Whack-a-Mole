**Welcome to Whack a Mole. In this fast-paced web game players click on randomly appearing moles on a 3x3 grid to test their reflexes. You get a timer set at 30 seconds, the objective is to score as many points as you can. You get points when you click on moles, but watch out, because clicking on a bomb immediately ends the game!**

## Features of the game 
- ***Random mole and bomb appearances***
- ***A scoring system with win/loss messages***

- ***A reset button to restart the game anytime***
- ***A countdown progress bar***


``Tip: For extra points, double click the Mole as soon as he appears in the Hole, but be careful because sometimes the same Hole get's replaced with a bomb``
